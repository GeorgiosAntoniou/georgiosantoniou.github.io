------
I am a postdoctoral researcher at INFN Rome and the Sapienza University of Rome, where I work on strong gravitational physics. Considering our relatively recent observational access to strong gravitational processes, the theoretical study of alternatives to General Relativity acquires particular interest.


**Interests - Keywords:**
Strong gravity, modified gravity, cosmology, compact objects, gravitational waves, quasinormal modes, well-posedness
